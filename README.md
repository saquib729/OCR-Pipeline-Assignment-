# OCR Based Medical Document Text Extraction & PII Redaction

This project extracts text from scanned medical documents (including handwritten notes) and automatically detects and redacts **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** such as Patient Name, IPD Number, UHID, Age, Sex, Phone Number, Dates, etc.  

It uses **EasyOCR** for handwritten and printed OCR and **OpenCV** for redaction operations.  
This project ensures secure and privacy–preserving conversion of physical health records into digital format.

## Features

- Extracts text from medical forms and case sheets
- Supports both printed and handwritten text
- Detects PII like Patient Name, IPD No., UHID, Age, Sex, Dates, Phone Numbers
- Automatically redacts PII by masking text on the image
- Saves:
  - Extracted text (`*_text.txt`)
  - Detected PII details (`*_pii.txt`)
  - Redacted medical images (`*_redacted.jpg`)
- Works **offline** — no cloud dependency
- Lightweight and easy to run
